## Setting up your Credentials

If you don't see a `credentials.json` file, you will need to rename `credentials_example.json` to `credentials.json`.

**This is how the `credentials.json` looks like with all the APIs:**

```json
{
  "ClientId": 179372110000358912,
  "Token": "MTc5MzcyXXX2MDI1ODY3MjY0.ChKs4g.I8J_R9XX0t-QY-0PzXXXiN0-7vo",
  "OwnerIds": [
    105635123466156544,
    105635123566156544,
    105635123666156544
  ],
  "LoLApiKey": "6e99ecf36f0000095b0a3ccfe35df45f",
  "GoogleApiKey": "AIzaSyDSci1sdlWQOWNVj1vlXxxxxxbk0oWMEzM",
  "MashapeKey": "4UrKpcWXc2mshS8RKi00000y8Kf5p1Q8kI6jsn32bmd8oVWiY7",
  "OsuApiKey": "4c8c8fdff8e1234581725db27fd140a7d93320d6",
  "CleverbotApiKey": "",
  "Db": null,
  "TotalShards": 1,
  "PatreonAccessToken": "",
  "PatreonCampaignId": "334038",
  "RestartCommand": null,
  "ShardRunCommand": "",
  "ShardRunArguments": "",
  "ShardRunPort": null,
  "TwitchClientId": null,
  "RedisOptions": null
}
```

#### Creating Discord Bot application

![img2](https://i.imgur.com/Vxxeh2n.gif)

- Go to [the Discord developer application page][DiscordApp].
- Log in with your Discord account.
- Create an application.
- On the **General Information** tab, fill out the `Name` field (it's your app's name)
- Upload an image if you want and add an app description. **(Optional)**
- Go to the **Bot** tab on the left sidebar.
- Click on the `Add a Bot` button and confirm that you do want to add a bot to this app.

#### Inviting your bot to your server

![img4](https://i.imgur.com/6beUSa5.gif)

- On the **General Information** tab, copy your `Client ID` from your [applications page][DiscordApp].
- Replace the **`12345678`** in this link:
  `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=`**`12345678`**`&scope=bot&permissions=66186303` with your `Client ID`.
- The link should now look like this:
  `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=`**`YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE`**`&scope=bot&permissions=66186303`
- Access that newly created link, pick your Discord server, click `Authorize` and confirm with the captcha at the end.
- The bot should have been added to your server.

#### Setting up credentials.json file

- **For Windows (Updater)**: the `credentials.json` file is located in the `C:\Program Files\NadekoBot\system` folder.
    - Note: there is a shortcut as well in `C:\Program Files\NadekoBot`, for easier access.
- **For Windows (Source), Linux and OSX**: the `credentials.json` file is located in the `NadekoBot/src/NadekoBot` folder.

##### Getting Client ID:

- On the **General Information** tab of your [applications page][DiscordApp], copy your `Client ID`.
- Open your `credentials.json` file and replace the `12312123` part of the **`"ClientId"`** line with it.
    - Be careful to not delete or move commas or quotation marks, this will break the file's syntax, making Nadeko unable to launch correctly.

It should look like this:

```json
"ClientId": 179372110000358912,
```

---

##### Getting the Bot's Token:

- On the **Bot** tab of your [applications page][DiscordApp], copy your `Token`.
    - *Note: Your bot Token **is not** the Client Secret! We won't need the Client Secret for anything.*
- Paste your bot token **between** the quotation marks on the **`"Token"`** line of your `credentials.json`.

It should look like this:

```json
"Token": "MTc5MzcyXXX2MDI1ODY3MjY0.ChKs4g.I8J_R9XX0t-QY-0PzXXXiN0-7vo",
```

##### Getting Owner ID*(s)*:

- Go to your Discord server and attempt to mention yourself, but put a backslash at the start:
  *(to make it slightly easier, add the backslash after you type the mention out)*
- For example, the message `\@fearnlj01#3535` will appear as `<@145521851676884992>` after you send the message.
- The message will appear as a mention if done correctly. Copy the numbers from it **`145521851676884992`** and replace the 0 on the `OwnerIds` section with your user ID.
- Save the `credentials.json` file.
- If done correctly, you should now be the bot owner. You can add multiple owners by seperating each owner ID with a comma within the square brackets.

For single owner, it should look like this:

```json
    "OwnerIds": [
        105635576866156544
    ],
```

For multiple owners, it should look like this (pay attention to the commas, the last ID should **never** have a comma next to it):

```json
    "OwnerIds": [
        105635123466156544,
        145521851676884992,
        341420590009417729
    ],
```

            - A new window will appear with your `Google API key`

            - Copy the key.
        - Open up **`credentials.json`** and look for **`"GoogleAPIKey"`**, paste your API key inbetween the quotation marks.

```

- **MashapeKey**

```json
"RestartCommand": {
    "Cmd": "NadekoBot.exe"
},
```

For Windows (Source), Linux or OSX, add this to your `credentials.json`

```json
"RestartCommand": {
    "Cmd": "dotnet",
    "Args": "run -c Release"
},
```

## Database

Nadeko saves all settings and data in the database file `NadekoBot.db`, located in:

- Windows (Updater): `C:\Program Files\NadekoBot\system\data`
- Windows (Source), Linux and OSX: `NadekoBot/src/NadekoBot/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.1/data/NadekoBot.db`

In order to open it you will need [SQLite Browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/).

*NOTE: You don't have to worry if you don't have the `NadekoBot.db` file, it gets automatically created once you successfully run the bot for the first time.*

**To make changes:**

- Shut your bot down.
- Copy the `NadekoBot.db` file to someplace safe. (Back up)
- Open it with SQLite Browser.
- Go to the **Browse Data** tab.
- Click on the **Table** drop-down list.
- Choose the table you want to edit.
- Click on the cell you want to edit.
- Edit it on the right-hand side.
- Click on **Apply**.
- Click on **Write Changes**.

## Sharding your bot

- **ShardRunCommand**
    - Command with which to run shards 1+
    - Required if you're sharding your bot on windows using .exe, or in a custom way.
    - This internally defaults to `dotnet`
    - For example, if you want to shard your NadekoBot which you installed using windows installer, you would want to set it to something like this: `C:\Program Files\NadekoBot\system\NadekoBot.exe`
- **ShardRunArguments**
    - Arguments to the shard run command
    - Required if you're sharding your bot on windows using .exe, or in a custom way.
    - This internally defaults to `run -c Release --no-build -- {0} {1} {2}` which will be enough to run linux and other 'from source' setups
    - {0} will be replaced by the `shard ID` of the shard being ran, {1} by the shard 0's process id, and {2} by the port shard communication is happening on
    - If shard0 (main window) is closed, all other shards will close too
    - For example, if you want to shard your NadekoBot which you installed using windows installer, you would want to set it to `{0} {1} {2}`
- **ShardRunPort**
    - Bot uses a random UDP port in [5000, 6000] range for communication between shards

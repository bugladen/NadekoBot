# Frequently Asked Questions

### Question 1: How do I get Nadeko to join my server?

---

**Answer:** Simply send Nadeko a Direct Message with `.h` and follow the link. **Only People with the Manage Server permission can add the bot to the server**

### Question 2: I want to change permissions, but it isn't working!

---

**Answer:** You must have the `.permrole` (by default this is the `Nadeko` role, for more details on permissions check [here](http://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Permissions%20System/ "Permissions"). If you have a role called `Nadeko` but can't assign it it's probably the Bot Role so, just create a **New Role** called `Nadeko` and assign that to yourself instead.)

### Question 3: I want to enable NSFW on a channel.

---

**Answer:** To enable the NSFW Module on one channel, type `.cm NSFW enable #channel-name`. If this does not work refer to Question 2. To enable NSFW for your **entire server**, type `.sm NSFW enable`.

### Question 4: How do I get NadekoFlowers/Currency?

---

**Answer:** You can get NadekoFlowers by picking them up after they have been generated with `.gc`, which you can then either plant (give away to a channel so that someone can pick it), or gamble with for potentinal profit with `.betflip`, `.betroll` and `.jr`. You can get flowers on the public bot by reacting on reaction events or by donating on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/nadekobot) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/Kwoth).

### Question 5: I have an issue/bug/suggestion, where do I put it so it gets noticed?

---

**Answer:** First, check [issues](https://gitlab.com/Kwoth/nadekobot/issues "GitLab NadekoBot Issues"), then check the [suggestions](https://nadeko.bot/suggest).

If your problem or suggestion is not there, feel free to request/notify us about it either in the Issues section of GitLab for issues or on [suggestions page](https://nadeko.bot/suggest) for suggestions.

### Question 6: How do I use this command?

---

**Answer:** You can see the description and usage of certain commands by using `.h command` **i.e** `.h .sm`.

The whole list of commands can be found [here](https://nadeko.bot/commands "Command List")

### Question 7: Music isn't working?

---

**Answer:** Music is disabled on public Nadeko due to large hosting costs, it will be re-enabled later in the future for donators.

**If you would like music in the meantime, you must host Nadeko yourself**. Be sure you have FFMPEG installed correctly, and have followed the [guide](http://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/Windows%20Guide/#setting-up-nadekobot-for-music) carefully.

### Question 8: My music is still not working/very laggy?

---

**Answer:** Try changing your discord [location][1], if this doesn't work be sure you have enabled the correct permissions for Nadeko and rebooted since installing FFMPEG.

### Question 9: I want to change data in the database like NadekoFlowers or something else but how?

---

**Answer:** Follow the [DB Guide](http://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/JSON%20Explanations/#db-files), Open `/data/NadekoBot.db` using **sqlitebrowser** (or some alternative), Browse Data, select relevant table, change data, Write changes and done.

### Question 10: The .greet and .bye commands doesn't work, but everything else is!

---

**Answer:** Set a greeting message by using `.greetmsg YourMessageHere` and a bye-message by using `.byemsg YourMessageHere`. Don't forget that `.greet` and `.bye` only apply to users joining a server, not coming online/offline.

### Question 11: I made an application, but I can't add that new bot to my server, how do I invite it to my server?

---

**Answer:** You need to use oauth link to add it to you server, just copy your **CLIENT ID** (that's in the same [Developer page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) where you brought your token) and replace `12345678` in the link below: **https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=`12345678`&scope=bot&permissions=66186303**

### Question 12: I'm building NadekoBot from source, but I get hundreds of (namespace) errors without changing anything!?

---

**Answer:** Using Visual Studio, you can solve these errors by going to `Tools` -> `NuGet Package Manager` -> `Manage NuGet Packages for Solution`. Go to the Installed tab, select the Packages that were missing (usually `Newtonsoft.json` and `RestSharp`) and install them for all projects

### Question 13: My bot has all permissions but it's still saying, "Failed to add roles. Bot has insufficient permissions". How do I fix this?

---

**Answer:** Discord has added few new features and the roles now follows the role hierarchy which means you need to place your bot's role above every-other role your server has to fix the role hierarchy issue. [Here's](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101) a link to Discords role management 101.

**Please Note:** *The bot can only set/add all roles below its own highest role. It can not assign it's "highest role" to anyone else.*

### Question 14: I've broken permissions and am stuck, can I reset permissions?

---

**Answer:** Yes, there is a way, in one easy command! Just run `.resetperms` and all the permissions you've set through **Permissions Module** will reset.

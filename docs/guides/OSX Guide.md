## Setting Up NadekoBot on OSX (macOS)

#### Prerequisites

- macOS 10.12 (Sierra) or higher (needed for .NET Core 2.x).
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Install it with `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` or update it with `brew update`.
- Text Editor (TextWrangler, or equivalent) or outside editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/).
- [Create Discord Bot application](http://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/JSON%20Explanations/#creating-discord-bot-application) and [Invite the bot to your server](http://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/JSON%20Explanations/#inviting-your-bot-to-your-server).

**Installing dependencies with Homebrew**

In terminal:

```
brew install wget
brew install git
brew install ffmpeg
brew update && brew upgrade ffmpeg
brew install openssl
brew install opus
brew install opus-tools
brew install opusfile
brew install libffi
brew install libsodium
brew install tmux
brew install python
brew install youtube-dl
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

**Installing .NET Core SDK**

- `ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/`
- `ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/`
- Download the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos)
- Open the `.pkg` file you downloaded and install it.
- `ln -s /usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin`

**Installing xcode-select**

- `xcode-select --install`

A dialog box will open asking if you want to install `xcode-select`. Select install and finish the installation.

#### Getting Nadeko Ready to Run

`cd ~ && wget -N https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoBot-BashScript/raw/1.9/linuxAIO.sh && bash linuxAIO.sh`
Choose `1. Download NadekoBot`
Once Installation is completed you should see the options again.

Choose Option 5 to set up your credentials according to this [guide](http://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/JSON%20Explanations/#setting-up-credentialsjson-file), or find and edit the `credentials.json` file manually.

Choose `6` (exit) if you would like to pause. Otherwise, continue.

#### Running NadekoBot

If you aren't seeing the six options in terminal, run `cd ~ && wget -N https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoBot-BashScript/raw/1.9/linuxAIO.sh && bash linuxAIO.sh`.

**The options:**

`2. Run Nadeko (Normally)`

If you shut down the bot with `.die`, it will stay offline until you manually run it again.

`3. Run Nadeko with Auto Restart`

If you shut down the bot with `.die`, it will restart automatically. To stop the bot, stop the bot proccess (close the terminal)

Option 3 will show you some more options:

- `1. Run Auto Restart normally without Updating.`: Bot will restart on `die` command and will not be downloading the latest build available.
- `2. Run Auto Restart and update NadekoBot.` Bot will restart and download the latest build available everytime `die` command is used.

#### Running with terminal closed

**Create a new Session:**

`tmux new -s nadeko`

This will create a new session named `nadeko` *(you can replace “nadeko” with anything you prefer, as long as you remember your session name)*

Run the bot in this session.
Detatch the session: `^b d`

**Attatching a detatched session**
`tmux a -t nadeko`

**Remember** that while running with Auto Restart, closing the terminal won't stop the bot proccess. To stop the bot from terminal:
`tmux kill-session -t nadeko`

#### Updating Nadeko

- Stop the bot, and make sure it is not running.
- Create a new tmux session if you are using tmux.
- `cd ~ && wget -N https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoBot-BashScript/raw/1.9/linuxAIO.sh && bash linuxAIO.sh`
- Choose `1` to update the bot with latest build available.
- Choose `2` or `3` to run the bot again.

#### Doing a clean reinstall

- Make a backup of your credentials (`~/NadekoBot/src/NadekoBot/credentials.json`)
- Make a backup of the database (`~/NadekoBot/src/NadekoBot/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.0/data/NadekoBot.db`)
- Delete the NadekoBot folder
- Reinstall, replace the files you backed up, and run.

#### Help! My music isn't working!

Make sure you have the [Google API Key](http://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/JSON%20Explanations/#setting-up-your-api-keys) in your `credentials.json`
If music still isn't working, try reinstalling ffmpeg:

- `brew options ffmpeg`
- `brew install ffmpeg --with-x --with-y --with-z` etc.
- `brew update && brew upgrade` (Update formulae and Homebrew itself && Install newer versions of outdated packages)
- `brew prune` (Remove dead symlinks from Homebrew’s prefix)
- `brew doctor` (Check your Homebrew installation for common issues)
- Then try `brew install ffmpeg` again.

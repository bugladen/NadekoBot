###Building from Source
For easy setup and no programming knowledge, you can use [Updater](https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoUpdater/releases/latest) or download release from [Releases](https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoBot/releases) and follow the [Windows Guide](Windows Guide.md)

In your bin/debug folder (or next to your exe if you are using release version), you must have a file called 'credentials.json' in which you will store all the necessary data to make the bot know who the owner is, and your api keys.

When you clone the project, make sure to run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to get the correct discord.net version

Make sure you've read ComprehensiveGuide to get a grasp of basic config/credentials setup and then look at "Credentials and config" chapter.

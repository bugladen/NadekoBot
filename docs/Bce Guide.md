# BotConfigEdit Guide

`.bce` allows you to conveniently set many of the bot-wide settings that Nadeko has, such as what the currency looks like, what people get when they use `.help`, and so on.
Below is a list of all the settings that can be set, with a quick instruction on how to use them, and their default value.

## BetflipMultiplier

The reward multiplier for correctly guessing a `.bf` (betflip) bet. Keep in mind you can't change the chance to guess the correct flip. It's always 50%.  
**Default is 1.95 (in other words, if you bet 100 and guess, you will get 195 as a reward)**

## Betroll100Multiplier

The reward multiplier for rolling 100 on `.br`.  
**Default is 10.0**

## Betroll67Multiplier

The reward multiplier for rolling 67 or higher on `.br`.  
**Default is 2.0**

## Betroll91Multiplier

The reward multiplier for rolling 91 or higher on `.br`.  
**Default is 4.0**

## CurrencyGenerationPassword

Either `true` or `false` value on whether the currency spawned with `.gc` command will have a random password associated with it in the top left corner. This helps prevent people who lurk in the chat and just spam `.pick` to gain flowers.  
**Default is `false`**

## CurrencyGenerationChance

A number between 0.0 and 1.0 which represents the chance that a message sent to a channel where `.gc` is enabled will spawn currency. 0 is 0% and 1.0 is 100%.  
**Default is 0.02. (That's 2% chance)**

## CurrencyGenerationCooldown

A number of seconds that the bot is guaranteed not to spawn any flowers again after doing so in a channel where `.gc` is enabled. This is useful if you have a pretty high chance of the flowers spawning in the channel (for whatever stupid reason) and don't want the chat to be flooded with currency spawn messages.  
**Default is 10**

## CurrencyName

Name of your currency. Mostly people aren't creative with this and just call them "Credit" or "Dollar". You can do better :^)  
**Default is NadekoFlower**

## CurrencyPluralName

Plural name of your currency (if you have currency name called "dollar" then put this to "dollars". I'm not sure if this is even used anywhere in the bot anymore.  
**Default is NadekoFlowers**

## CurrencySign

Emoji of your currency. You can use server emojis, though occasionally it will fail to send it correctly on other servers.  
**Default is ðŸŒ¸**

## DmHelpString

The string which will be sent whenever someone DMs the bot. Supports embeds. How it looks: [https://puu.sh/B0BLV.png](https://puu.sh/B0BLV.png)  
**Default is "Use `.h` for help"**

## HelpString

The strings which will be sent whenever someone types `.h`. Supports embeds. You can also use {0} placeholder which will be replaced with your bot's client id, and {1} placeholder which will be replaced with your bot's prefix. How it looks: [https://puu.sh/B0BMa.png](https://puu.sh/B0BMa.png)  
**Default is too long to type out (check the screenshot)**

## CurrencyDropAmount

The amount of currency which will drop when `.gc` spawn is triggered. This will be the minimum amount of currency to be spawned if CurrencyDropAmountMax is also specified.  
**Default is 1**

## CurrencyDropAmountMax

Setting this value will make currency generation spawn a random amount of currency between CurrencyDropAmount and CurrencyDropAmountMax, inclusive.  
**Default is 0**

## TriviaCurrencyReward

The amount of currency awarded to the winner of the trivia game.  
**Default is 0**

## XpPerMessage

The amount of XP the user receives when they send a message (which is not too short).  
**Default is 3**

## XpMinutesTimeout

This value represents how often the user can receive XP from sending messages.  
**Default is 5**

## MinWaifuPrice

Minimum price the users can pay to claim a waifu with `.claim`.  
**Default is 50**

## WaifuGiftMultiplier

The multiplier applied to the price of waifu gifts, making them more or less expensive.  
**Default is 1**

## MinimumTriviaWinReq

Users can't start trivia games which have smaller win requirement than specified by this setting.  
**Default is 0**

## MinBet

Minimum amount of currency a user can gamble with in a single gamble. Set 0 to disable.  
**Default is 0**

## MaxBet

Maximum amount of currency a user can gamble with in a single gamble. Set 0 to disable.  
**Default is 0**

## OkColor

Hex of the color which will show on the left side of the bot's response when a command succesfully executes. Example: [https://puu.sh/B0BXd.png](https://puu.sh/B0BXd.png)  
**Default is 00e584**

## ErrorColor

Hex of the color which will show on the left side of the bot's response when a command either errors, or you can't perform some action. Example: [https://puu.sh/B0BXs.png](https://puu.sh/B0BXs.png)  
**Default is ee281f**

## ConsoleOutputType

2 values, either 'Simple' or 'Normal'. Normal is the usual amount, and the simple one shows only basic info about the executed commands in the console. Here is a comparison: [https://puu.sh/B0Chn.png](https://puu.sh/B0Chn.png)  
**Default is 'Normal'**

## DailyCurrencyDecay

The percentage of currency all users will lose every 24 hours. The value goes between 0 and 1.0 (0 being 0% to 1.0 being 100%). This is a useful tool to control the inflation :)  
**Default is 0**

## CheckForUpdates

Whether the bot will see if there are updates available. The patch notes will be sent to Bot Owner's DM. The bot checks for updates once every 8 hours. There are 3 available values:  

- None: The bot will not check for updates
- Commit: This is useful for linux self-hosters - the bot will check for any new commit on the NadekoBot repository.
- Release: This is useful for windows self-hosters - the bot will check for any new releases published on the NadekoBot repository. This setting is also useful for linux self-hosters who only want to update when it's pretty safe to do so :)

**Default is Release**

## PatreonCurrencyPerCent

You need this only if you have a patreon page, and you've specified the PatreonCampaignId and PatreonAccessToken in credentials.json. This value is the amount of currency the users will get with `.clparew` for each cent they've pledged. Also make sure your patreon is set to charge upfront, otherwise people will be able to pledge, claim reward and unpledge without getting charged.  
**Default is 1**
